Hey! This is a self-bot for discord. Posted by: JKBentley.

Instructions:
Ctrl + Shift + I - on top there will be an icon similar to closing quotes, poke at it and select Applications.
Expand Local Storage - https://discordapp.com. At the very end of the list, your token will be. Then copy it and paste it into the JSON file (in the appropriate line).
Save and you can run.

Used the code from JKTimosha.

P.S Sorry for my language, I used google translate.
